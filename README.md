Front-End in React: [Click Here](https://github.com/MurituMaina/hustler_job_board)  

Backend in Rails: [Click Here](https://github.com/MurituMaina/hustler_job_board_back_end)

2. Open the root of the folder on your visual studio code.

3. Navigate to the backend directory, and execute ```bundle install```
and this command will install all the necessary gems required for the program to execute followed by ```rails db:migrate db:seed```

4. Run ```rails server ``` and this will deploy the backend to the local host

Also, the project is deployed separately and should work with an active internet connection:\
    - The frontentend repository is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)\
    - The backend repository is deployed on [railways](https://railways.app/)
